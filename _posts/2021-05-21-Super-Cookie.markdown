## Description 
Supercookies is just a term which is used in the case of Privacy trackers. Privacy trackers are third-party applications which store the user identification details. Firefox introduced a new feature which implemented partitioning network state and caches.

Using a separate network states and caches for each new website the user accesses, makes the application more secure and prevents Cross-Site Tracking.

While the move is a positive addition for privacy-conscious users, there are concerns that partitioning will affect the browserâ€™s performance.

Mozilla claims that its metrics show a "very modest impact" on page load time "between a 0.09% and 0.75% increase at the 80th percentile and below, and a maximum increase of 1.32% at the 85th percentile".
