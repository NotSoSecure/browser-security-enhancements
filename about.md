The browsers are currently implementing lots of changes day by day. We will be listing changes relevant to security enhancements which known browsers have implemented recently. To name a few, we will be discussing about the changes such as Tabnabbing protection, Referrer Leakage Preventions, HTTPS-Only mode, X-XSS-Protection and Cookie related security enhancement which can be used to prevent Client-Side vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery. Security updates are aimed to be updated on regular intervals.
